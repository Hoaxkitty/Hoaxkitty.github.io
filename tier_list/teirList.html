<h2 id="tier1" >Tier 1: God Tier</h2>	
<h2>Bonuses are consistent and game changingly strong.</h2>

<h3>Babylon:</h3>  
<p>Ingenuity give a very strong early boost to science generation with a free scientist. The bonus generation to great scientists is very strong mid and late-game for bulbing.</P>
<h3>Egypt:</h3>  
<p>Monument Builders bonus production to wonders is invaluable early and late-game.</P>
<h3>England:</h3>  
<p>Longbows have 3 range so they are unbelievably strong and allow for quite easy wars. Ships of the Line are by far the strongest mid-game naval unit and with Sun Never Sets and other bonuses can be unstoppable. Extra spys never hurt either.</P>
<h3>Ethopia:</h3>  
<p>Spirit of Adwa gives increased combat bonuses for less cities which are great for defensive and offensive strategy if going tall. Steles give culture and faith which give an amazing head start on all cities and you empire.</P>
<h3>Inca:</h3>  
<p>Decreased road cost in hills with Great Andean Road and increadable growth from Terrace Farms let you thrive in very defensive positions</P>
<h3>Korea:</h3>  
<p>Consistent science bonuses from Scholars of the Jade Hall and 2 powerful defensive units, Hwach'a and Turtle Ship, allow for amazing snowballing.</P>
<h3>Persia:</h3>  
<p>Extended golden ages from Achaemenid Legacy and the bonuses given during them are incredibly strong. Immortals are very strong early againsts barbarians.</P>
<h3>Poland:</h3>  
<p>	Solidarity gives free social policies that can end up giving you an extra completed tree by late-game allowing for more risks to be taken and more flexible game play.</P>
<h3>Huns:</h3> 
<p>Battering Rams are the strongest very early-game units that can give you a whole city head start and Horse Archers give great offensive ability on flat land. Scourge of God gives double horses for your Horse Archers plus production on horse tiles, but also starts you 1 whole tech ahead and the start of the game. </P>
<h3>Maya:</h3> 
<p>Free great people from The Long Count is very strong if you time it right. Pyramid gives a great buff to science as well as faith generation.</P>

<h2 id="tier2" >Tier 2: Strong</h2>	
<h2>Bonuses are consistent and strong or situational and game changingly strong.</h2>

<h3>Arabia:</h3> 
<p>Camal Archers are superb at warfare and stats wise. Bazaar allows for more trade and gold. Ships of the Desert Bonus oil is invaluable late-game plus increased trade route efficiency give alot of gold.</p>
<h3>Aztec:</h3> 
<p>Amazing growth from Floating Gardens, but needs to be near lakes. Jaguar Warrior is great for scouting early game.</p>
<h3>China:</h3> 
<p>Strong early science plus gold from Paper Makers is quite strong. Chu Ko Nus and great general bonuses are amazing for wars. Art of War great general generation and added combat stats are very strong.</p>
<h3>Greece:</h3> 
<p>Under the right conditions with Hellenic League you can lose 0 influence with City-States. Strong early-game units, Hoplite and Companion Cavalry, are great for early conquest and defence.</p>
<h3>Russia:</h3> 
<p>Siberian Riches production bonuses scale well into the late-game and double resources is invaluable for massive wars. Cossaks are great for pushing advantages in wars and Krepost are good for expansion.</p>
<h3>Shoshone:</h3> 
<p>Great Expanses extra city tiles means you save alot of gold and culture per city. Scout replacement is very good to get head starts from ruins.</p>
<h3>Spain:</h3> 
<p>Under the right conditions Seven Cities of Gold can single handedly win you a game only a few turns in from the massive advantage from an extra city or 2 can give when everyone else has 1. This is all up to RNG so Seven Cities of Gold can also flop and give you almost nothing.</p>
<h3>Zulu:</h3> 
<p>Reduced land maintenance from Iklwa is strong. Impis plus Ikanda buffs provide many high level troops that can tear through anything they meet. Very one dimensiponal civ and if your wars dont succeed you the bonuses are mediocre.</p>

<h2 id="tier3" >Tier 3: Decent</h2>	
<h2>Bonuses are consistent and mediocre or situational and strong.</h2>

<h3>Byzantium:</h3> 
<p>An extra religion belief from Patriarchate of Constantinople is always strong and lets you get an nice early religion. Dromon is the strongest early-game naval unit and is the only ranged one in Classical and Ancient era.</p>
<h3>Celts:</h3> 
<p>Increased faith from Druidic Lore is nice but your city must be close to many forest tiles to make use of it. Ceilidh Hall is strong and Pictish Warriors provide nice bursts of faith early-game.</p>
<h3>Germany:</h3> 
<p>The chance of incorporating barbarians from Furor Teutonicus is nice early game and with reduced land maintenance the extra troops won't hurt your economy to much. Hanse gives strong bunuses to gold and production near many City-States.</p>
<h3>India:</h3> 
<p>Population Growth allows for your cities to generate less unhappiness than other empires late-game.</p>
<h3>Indonesia:</h3> 
<p>Kris Swordsman are usually very bad and even detremental to build sine most of their bonuses end up being negative. Candi gives decent faith generation. Spice Islanders is very good as long as you can find islands to settle.</p>
<h3>Mongolia:</h3> 
<p>Keshiks single handedly bring Mongolia up from Tier 4 and are almost on par with Camal Archers. Khans give decent bonuses. Mongol Terror doesn't effect Keshiks which is probably just poor programing and the bonus verses City-States is negligable.</p>
<h3>Rome:</h3> 
<p>Legions are very strong and let you keep your supply lines efficient if you use them to build infastructure and Ballista is decent. The Glory of Rome gives good bonuses but you have to sacrifice time building in your capital first to take advantage of it.</p>
<h3>Siam:</h3> 
<p>Naresuan's elephant are decently strong and Wats are alright is you are near alot of jungles. Father Governs Children are fairly good but not worth investing that much into City-States.</p>
<h3>Songhai:</h3> 
<p>Mandekalu Cavalry have neat bonuses but otherwise are a mediocre improvement. Mud Pyramid Mosques give bonus culture which is nice. River Warlord isn't that strong since amphibious bonuses aren't too strong to begin with and the triple gold from barbarian camps and pillagin cities makes you strategies very one dimensional.</p>
<h3>America:</h3> 
<p>B-17s are fairly strong and Minuteman bonuses are fairly good but nothing spectacular. Manifest Destiny is alright for grabbing tiles in contested areas but is otherwise nothing too strong.</p>
<h3>Austria:</h3> 
<p>Coffe Houses are great replacements to windmills since you can build them in every city. Hussars give negligable bonuses. Diplomatic Marriage is a massive investment to annex a City-State which might not even be in a good spot, and warfare is just easier and takes less time.</p>
<h3>Denmark:</h3> 
<p>Berserkers are fairly strong. Norwegian ski infantry are just bad and thier bonus will most likely never be used in a game you are winning. Viking Fury gives decent bonuses but aren't very good against players who know what they are doing.</p>

<h2 id="tier4" >Tier 4: Weak</h2>	
<h2>Bonuses are consistent but weak or situational and mediocre.</h2>

<h3>Sweden:</h3> 
<p>Hakkapeliitta and Carolean aren't much of an upgrade from their replacements to be worth it. Nobel Prize gives good boosts to influence with City-States but giving away great people is just not worth it.</p>
<h3>Brazil:</h3> 
<p>Pracinha comes too late to matter. Brazilwood Camps can be very strong but take alot of setup and thats assuming you are near alot of jungle. Carnival is good bonuses for tourism but most games aren't won off of flat tourism generation and even with the bonuses its difficult to pull off well.</p>
<h3>Assyria:</h3> 
<p>Siege Towers are alright but nothing great. Royal Library bonuses are negligable. Treasures of Nineveh force you to go into wars or else you will never get the bonuses to an extra tech when they matter.</p>
<h3>Morocco:</h3> 
<p>Berber Cavalry aren't the best but are still okay. Kasbahs are only worth it if you have Petra which is highly contested so that limits your potential. Gateway to Africa give you alright trade route bonuses but they also give bonuses to other empires which isn't ideal ever.</p>
<h3>Portugal:</h3>
<p>Naus bonuses don't give that much extra gold. Feitorias can be countered very easily by players who know what they are doing. Mare Clausum gives an alright boost to trade routes.</p>

<h2 id="tier5" >Tier 5: Awful</h2>	
<h2>Bonuses are consistently inconsequential or situational and weak.</h2>

<h3>Carthage:</h3> 
<p>African Forst Elephants are fairly strong. Quinqueremes are bad because triremes which are what they replace are bad. Phoenician Heritage gives almost no bonuses that you will ever use or will be noticable in a game.</p>
<h3>Netherlands:</h3>
<p>Sea Beggars can be unbelievably strong but you need a strong economy and alot of infastructure build up. Polders can also be amazing but only is you are blessed with the Polder dream of marshes or flood plains EVERYWHERE!!! Dutch East India Company bad because you end up giving a bonus to other empires and the bonus you get back is worse than what they get.</p> 
<h3>France:</h3> 
<p>Chateaus are fine improvements but nothing great. Musketeers are bad. City of Light gives flat tourism bonuses which again usually doesn't win games ever.</p>
<h3>Japan:</h3> 
<p>Samurai are fairly strong but fall off harder since they skip an upgrade. Zeros are fairly god since they don't take up an oil resource. Bushidos bonuses are almost never noticable unless its in an extreme case and the bonus culture is never enough to matter either.</p>
<h3>Polynesia:</h3> 
<p>Maori Warriors are okay early-but nothing great. Moais usually don't give that great bonuses unless the RNG gods give you the ideal sets of land. Wayfinding is a non-factor after everyone has The Compass tech.</p>
<h3>Ottomans:</h3> 
<p>Janissaries and Sipahis are just okay. Barbary Corsairs only good bonus is you pay 1/3 naval maintenence but even than it's not that strong.</p>

<h2 id="tier6" >Tier 6: Joke</h2>	
<h2>Bonuses are detrimental to the civilization.</h2>

<h3>Iroquois:</h3> 
<p>Longhouses bonuses are worse than what it replaces. The Great Warpath only works on continuous forests and if you enter a forest tile it consumes all movement whihc is mostly what you would use it for.</p>
<h3>Venice:</h3> 
<p>Serenissima makes you not able to build other cities which means you can only annex City-States with Merchants of Venice and City-States are usually in bad positions. You also can only puppet these cities so you effectivly only ever have 1 city.</p>
